# Innovation Field Notes – W9
## Key learnings
This week, we've recalibrated ourselves back to the end of the previous course [[0. 🏕 Basecamp/MOC – DA620E-TS004 Innovation and entrepreneurship in a digital society\|MOC – DA620E-TS004 Innovation and entrepreneurship in a digital society]], where we were back then, and how we're going to more forward. We had the Snowball workshop where we collected each others perspectives and synthesized them into one unified view.

We refreshed our memory about main points to remember about innovation and change work, such as 
- The complexity we're operating in. 
- That innovation is something that's desirable, feasible, viable and credible. 
- The importance of aligning needs, product and market and that coherence is key for innovation to be successful.
- Assumptions are unavoidable – but we need to validate, validate, validate!
Following this, we had an interesting seminar about our top learnings, uncertainties and design implications right now. We had two guest lectures about Patents (which is perhaps more closely related to an inventor's work than an innovator's) and Business Model Canvas. We ended the week by putting ourselves out there and presenting a failure. I talked about What Lies Ahead which exemplified pretty much all of the traps we've learned to avoid. 

Something that became clearer to me this week is the difference between understanding innovation conceptually and putting it into practise. I've been comfortable discussing innovation on a higher level through complexity, transformation and change agents, but not as comfortable breaking it down to testable components. The Business Model Canvas is one example that provides such structure.

We've really seen that validation, alignment and coherence are iterative processes that help us move away from the understanding of innovation as linear but rather a continuous process that requires perseverance and grit.

## Personal reflections
I really enjoyed this first week. I think it was the perfect opening to pick up on where we left off. It was interesting to me that even though we had different areas of interest from the previous course, the collective attitude was "we understand the theory – now how do we put this into practise?" I feel very good about getting the chance to come back to these learnings and uncertainties and fill in the blanks in this course. It feels like a well thought out next step. 

My initial feeling is that this course is exactly what I've been looking for. I want to become better at taking something from being just a concept and into something that works in the real world. As I mentioned in my presentation, that is a completely different thing that requires different skills. That requires more than mindset and a good idea. And this is where my previous studies really lacked coverage and I know that I have lots to learn here. I feel very aligned with this current path – also in relation to my Personal Development Plan. This course kind of ties it together. 

The exercise about filling in the Business Model Canvas everyone together was fun and insightful. Magnus confirmed a lot of things we've already discussed. I found this format to be very engaging as opposed to dividing into smaller groups and ending with a presentation. I found myself appreciating and being inspired by Magnus talent to really engage everyone in the audience. It was impressive. He did so with personal stories, humour, interactivity, lots of eye contact, an authoritative but humane tone and asking questions without demanding a "correct answer". It was both playful and educational. 

Somehow, I also found it freeing to talk about What Lies Ahead. This failure that left a sour taste in my mouth ever since. It's almost therapeutic to have this space to constructively dissect, evaluate and discuss parts about myself that have affected my confidence and sense of self in various ways. I appreciate this in our program as I clearly see an increase in my ability to let go of these experiences and grow past them. I see myself developing, which I'm grateful for.

## Questions & curiosities
I want to circle back to the uncertainties I wrote about in the beginning of the week as they are still key to me.

**I believe we need a clearer grasp of the status quo.**
Early on in the previous course, a change agent was defined as “someone who changes the status quo and drives sustainable transformation that creates value and positive impact for people, organizations and society”. One thing I’m lacking here is a greater discussion on what this status quo actually looks like. So much is happening around us, just within the technological development alone, and we need to keep up with that if we want to be relevant in it. In our Emerging Tech course, we touched on how robotics and AI is used in military and war. This is a great example of an area that I've deliberately chosen to avoid looking into, because it's too overwhelming. But we NEED to look into these things – because this IS what's happening around us, right now. We need to be aware of that, and we need to discuss how to handle it to be able to avoid a collective feeling of paralysis. 

**That leads to the question... are we future-ready?**
Do we have the tools, frameworks, skills and knowledge to understand, navigate and responsibly transform the very complex problems we are facing? This isn’t just a question for this programme but in a broader sense too. How can we be sure that we’re well equipped when everything is unpredictable and constantly changing? How do we handle resistance to change when it is constantly happening? And most importantly, are we asking the hard questions and facing the uncomfortable truths needed to ensure a viable way forward?

This also relates to what I brought up during the seminar about innovation not always aligning with business interests. Most business acknowledge that innovation is good and needed – but aren't necessarily willing to embrace what innovation takes to succeed. For example, failing constantly until we unfail. And this is something I want to explore further. Patrik said something interesting about letting the big guys feel like they make the decision, when you actually lay all the pieces out so that the puzzle almost completes itself. But there's a big difference in just presenting the puzzle, and letting them place the final piece and feel good about their oh so genius mind. Feed their ego. I'll remember this.

I'm curious to see how my attitude is going to be towards business after this course, when I'm hopefully more knowledgeable in the area. Because as of now, one part of me frankly dislikes anything business. It doesn't interest me. Parts of it even repulses me. Money-making machines with poor ethics and a broken moral compass is just not something that I vibe with. But I understand that this reaction is a result of bad experiences. It's not true that all business is bad. Magnus said it very well: that even organizations with altruistic incentives need to consider the BMC aspects because that's what's going to drive the ability to do good. That spoke to the other part of me which is also curious about the entrepreneurial spirit, about realizing big things, raising money and doing it for good. People often ask me why I don't start my own business. And that question kind of triggers me. So it will be interesting to see whether I'll get more insight in where I actually stand in this question the upcoming months.

## Future actions
The first I'll focus on is taking steps to becoming more comfortable working with complexity. Instead of getting overwhelmed and lost in it, I need to use my strategic and organizational skills to break it down to smaller pieces that are possible to work with. Until this point, I've converged, and now it might be a good time to diverge. In upcoming projects, mapping out complexity to reveal crucial pain points and opportunities is something I want to practically implement. I'll also remember that constraints is my friend – sometimes limiting a scope is more productive than trying to cover everything or trying to perfect.

I'll also work on calibrating my mindset to better match my capabilities, as well as focus more on my capabilities. From working with my Personal Development Plan, I've realized how much I actually belittle myself internally and that the way I think of myself doesn't match what I actually do. So, I'll continue taking actions that are uncomfortable but needed to continuously convince my mind of my capabilities. One example is challenging my discomfort in speaking (which is improving, though) with speaking even more authentically. Because I've seen that this is when people are actually most likely to listen to what I have to say.

Speaking of capabilities and limiting beliefs, I'll continue working on normalizing failure. Not only was that liberating, but I think very strengthening in the long run. If I didn't get so caught up with failure, I believe I would be much more willing to take risk and put myself out there. It's just a mindset. 

Finally, I want to reiterate gut feeling. I don't think we give ourselves and others enough credit for following gut feeling, especially in business. We know that people lie and don't always say what they actually mean. From here on I'll try to be extra attentive to people's reactions as opposed to their words and see how much I can intuitively pick up on that might point to authenticity or misalignment. 

## Methods & tools
BMC is a practical tool I can use to deal with the complexity and interrelational nature of innovation. I believe tools like these are very useful to me since I can easily get caught up in inquisitive loops and existential rabbit holes in my mind. These might be good ways to ground me in something concrete rather than philosophical. 

A common mistake is to treat BMC as a way to check boxes. We saw in the lecture/workshop that it can be a very useful tool to prototype business, for example. When starting to put things out there to experiment with how they affect each other. But I can also see a risk with oversimplifying the complex reality. In the end, it needs to be continuously tested and validated against reality to work. So, it might be useful in early-stage prototyping when visualization is beneficial of fluid ideas. Maybe not as useful when dealing with systemic or societal problems that might not translate so well into business logic.

## Resources
**Simon Sinek – Leaders Eat Last** (book)
https://simonsinek.com/books/leaders-eat-last/
I believe this book covers a type of leadership that resonates well with me. That it's essentially about making people feel safe. This book also highlights the importance of leaders understanding the true purpose of their organization and implementing that into how they care for their people. 

**Eric Ries – The Lean Startup** (book)
A direct connection to validation and experimentation, assumptions and coherence. It also talks about the mindset shift from planning to testing which feels very relevant to where I'm curretly at.
